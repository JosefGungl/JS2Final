          <b>What does checking-in do for me?</b>
          <p>Hitting that check-in button will do 2 things for you: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>gives you 1 pt</li>
            <li>adds 1 day onto your check-in streak</li>
          </ul>

          <b>What is the check-in streak?</b>
          <p>The check-in streak is exactly what it sounds like, how many consecutive days you have checked in at the gym. </p>
          <p>But be careful, if you miss a day you will lose your entire streak!</p>

          <b>How often can I check-in?</b>
          <p>You can only check-in once per day. This means check in when you get here to get your point
          but you'll only be able to do this once per day.</p>
